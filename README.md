👋 Hi, I’m @Wesdormu, Dutch immigrant living and working in the USA.
I speak three languages, Dutch, English (fluent) and German intermediate.
Hoping to add some coding languages to that list some time sooN!

👀 I’m interested in back-end development, videogames, story telling and world-building.
Hoping to eventually find my way into the videogames industry, something which has long been a dream and I'm finally taking action towards.
 
🌱 I just started my first coding course and am learning how ot use python right now.
 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of beginner friendly projects.
If you are an indie game designer and also learning on the go, I'd happily join you on that journey.
If you need someone to bounce ideas about story's and worlds off, I'm your guy!
 
📫 How to reach me...
Either here on GitHub or add me on Discord, You'll find me there under the same name. Wesdormu.
